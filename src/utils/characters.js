    bio: `Finn debuted at age 12 but aged over the course of the show, and was 17 by the series finale. Finn sets off on magical random quests around the Land of Ooo. He would gladly fight or beat up anything evil, but would not harm anything good or "neutral". Having a strong moral code, Finn swore that he would help anyone in need and often performs heroic feats to save the day; however, Finn's enthusiastic nature becomes more toned down as the series progresses, suggesting he is both maturing and developing as a character as he ages. As shown in "Memories of Boom Boom Mountain", Finn appears to have been abandoned in the woods during infancy. He had fallen onto a large leaf and lay there crying until Joshua and Margaret, Jake's parents, rescued him from the wilderness and took him in to raise him alongside Jake, who became like a brother to him. According to the episode "The Vault", Finn has had a number of past lives. In "Red Starved", it is revealed that Finn is color blind, believing that an emerald was a ruby.
    In the Season 6 premiere "Escape From the Citadel", Finn has lost half of his right arm, from which a flower protruded. He later regains his arm, now as a prosthetic, in the episode "Breezy", only to lose it again in the episode "Reboot" when his grass arm transforms itself into a humanoid, sentient being. In the following episode "Two Swords", Finn gets fitted with a new robotic arm, which can transform into many different weapons.
    Finn's ultimate fate is not revealed; however, the series finale "Come Along With Me" implies that the rabbit-like creature Shermy, who finds Finn's discarded prosthetic arm, is Finn's latest reincarnation. A fallen statue of Finn also appears in the episode's opening sequence, set in this future world.`

    bio: `Jake was conceived when his father, Joshua, was bitten by the shapeshifting extra-dimensional creature Warren Ampersand during a detective investigation with his wife Margaret, and was later born from a pustule on his father's head originating from the creature's bite. It is inferred that Jake's magical powers are a result of his biological relationship with Ampersand, though he is apparently unaware of the circumstances of his birth and instead believes his powers to be the result of having rolled around in a "magical mud puddle" as a pup. After his birth, Jake was raised normally by Joshua and Margaret as their son, alongside their own biological son Jermaine and their adoptive human son Finn.
    Little has been shown in the series about Jake's subsequent childhood life with his family, though in his youth, he was known to be a successful criminal and the leader of his own gang, a position he later retired from to take part in a more respectable life as an adventurer with Finn. Around this time, he also began a romantic relationship with Lady Rainicorn, with whom he has five children—daughters Charlie, Viola, and Jake Jr., and sons T.V. and Kim Kil Whan. 
   Jake's stretchy powers enable him to modify the size, shape, and dimensions of every part of his body. Not only can he stretch and contort himself into highly specific forms, but he can also rearrange his internal organs, and teeth. In "Evicted!", he is able to shrink and move his internal organs and blood into his left thumb. Also in "Jake vs. Me-Mow", he enlarges his liver fifty-one times a dog his size, preventing him from succumbing to Me-Mow's poison. One frequent use of his powers is Key Hand, which he uses to pick locks. He also uses his arm as a bow able to accurately shoot arrows at a short distance.`

    name: "Marceline",

    real_name: "Marceline Abadeer",
    img: marceline,
    color: colors.gray_light,
    age: 1000,
    occupation: "Musician",
    specie: "Vampire/ Demon",
    sex: "Female",
    profile: marcelineProfile,
    bio: `Marceline is one of the major characters in Adventure Time. Although she did not appear in the series' pilot, the groundwork for her design and character were present in the series pitch book, penned by series creator Pendleton Ward. Ward purposely set out to make Marceline's character complex, as he explained that "with the female characters it's easy to either write them as clichés or write them as the extreme opposite of those clichés ... I just try to make them have faults and strengths just like Finn and Jake have."Initially, in the series bible, Marceline is described as being "friendly rivals" with Bubblegum.
    The design for Marceline was created by Ward, with small changes and additions added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for Adventure Time.Visually, Marceline has long, dark hair. She rarely walks on the ground, generally preferring to float when she travels, moves, and sleeps. Marceline, unlike many of the other characters, wears varying outfits in most of her appearances. Ward said her clothing changes from episode to episode because "girls own more than one outfit".Olivia Olson, the voice actress who plays Marceline, was impressed by her character's fashion design stating, "she has really cool style ... I love what they come up with every episode." Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode, she is "totally surprised" by the costuming for Marceline.While she says her lines, she is able to view the animatics for the episode and sometimes has to stop to admire the unique designs. Marceline's physical size and shape slightly changes depending on who is drawing her. Rynda later called this "one of the coolest parts" about the character's animation due to the fact that "every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw."`

    name: "Ice King",

    real_name: "Simon Petrikov",

    color: colors.blue_ice,
    age: 1043,
    occupation: "Monarch of the Ice Kingdom",
    specie: "Ice Wizard",
    sex: "Male",
    profile: iceKingProfile,
    bio: `Ice King is a frequent antagonist and occasional ally of Finn and Jake who kidnaps princesses throughout to forcefully marry them. His ice-based magic abilities come from a magical crown he wears, which directly causes his insanity. Though defined as crazy by many, the character is also lonely and misunderstood, having a generally benevolent relationship with the penguins of his realm. When he briefly had a wife, he actually treated her with great care and love. Whenever he kidnaps princesses, he treats them with care and respect. Aside from the actual imprisonment, their only protests seem to be that they don't like him and he occasionally could become possessive and slightly creepy. Despite rarely meaning harm, Ice King is still potentially very dangerous due to his power and his unstable mind which warps his sense of morality and socially acceptable behavior. Furthermore, unaware that the two learned of his origins as Simon Petrikov before being driven insane by the crown's influence, he is somewhat envious of Finn and Jake for being such good friends.
    Ice King's crown, the source of his powers, was created in the prehistoric past by an ice elemental named Urgence Evergreen to avert a meteor from hitting the planet. After finishing the crown, arranging it to imprint its original bearer's mind while granting the user their deepest desire, Evergreen ends up being incapacitated and is forced to entrust his apprentice Gunther to wear the crown to have him destroy the meteor in his place. But having never been taught magic by Evergreen, Gunther ended up wishing to be more like his mentor from his perspective, transformed into a clone of Evergreen and is unable to stop the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. The crown survived the event and would continue its first owner's wish to turn future users into insane parodies of Evergreen.`

    real_name: "Bonnibel Bubblegum",
    img: bubblegum,
    color: colors.pink,
    age: 19,
    occupation: "Ruler of the Candy Kingdom, Scientist",
    specie: "Gum Golem",
    sex: "Female",
    profile: bubblegumProfile,
    bio: `Bubblegum is typically very kind and compassionate, having a strong sense of justice, though she shows a dark side when provoked. She is highly intelligent, being responsible for the creation of the Candy People as well as various devices including a miniature time machine. She is fluent in German and Korean, using the latter language to communicate with her friend Lady Rainicorn. Bubblegum is skeptical of magic, refusing to acknowledge it as anything except science.
    Bubblegum is highly protective of the Candy People and cares deeply for their safety, but is secretly strained by the pressures of ruling and expresses a desire for freedom. Following a near-death experience at the end of the second season, she starts to isolate herself and becomes overprotective of the Candy People, even exhibiting authoritarian tendencies temporarily in the fifth season. At the end of the sixth season, Bubblegum is deposed as ruler following an election, where she realizes she has made the Candy People too unintelligent.
    Bubblegum has light pink skin and long magenta "hair", which is actually bubblegum. Her usual outfit is a puffy-sleeved pink gown with purple trim. Among many other outfits, she often wears a lab coat during science experiments.
    In the seventh season, Bubblegum discovers that she is an incarnation of the "Candy Elemental", the living embodiment of candy as one of the Adventure Time universe's four classical elements (fire, water, candy, and slime). As the Elemental, she can materialize various quantities of candy through her hands and communicate with past incarnations of the Elemental.`

BMO is characterized as a loyal, trusting and helpful robot who is protective of Finn and Jake.
    BMO looks like a Macintosh computer with Game Boy Color buttons and Atari 2600 controllers. They also share some traits with a Vectrex.

BMO is about 12.25 inches wide and 20.1 inches tall.
BMO's front includes an arrow pad, a floppy disk slot, multiple different shape buttons, two controller sockets, and of course the face, or screen. There is also a compartment with a red button hidden underneath the yellow D-pad. BMO's operating system known as BMOS (abbreviated from "Be More Operating System") is somewhat similar to that of a Windows/Macintosh hybrid computer, as seen in "Be More," with a graphical interface and drag-and-drop file manager.`
